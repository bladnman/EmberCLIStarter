### ReqPayload (static)

During local development you will want to be able to load Destro in your browser. To do so you need 
to copy the `/config/reqpayload.temaplate.js` file to `/config/reqpayload.local.js`. You
will find instructions inside of the template file.

After this you can restart your local server with `ember server` and then skip passed authorization 
by going to the url: [http://localhost:4200/profiles](http://localhost:4400/profiles)
